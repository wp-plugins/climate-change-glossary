This plugin imports a SKOS thesaurus, highlights terms and generates links automatically for any terms available in the thesaurus.

== Description ==

With this plugin any SKOS thesaurus can be imported into your Wordpress blog (via ARC2 into an RDF triple store). A renewable energy and climate change thesaurus is pre-installed.
On two pages (automatically generated) the whole thesaurus can be displayed and used as a glossary on your blog. One page is the main page of the glossary which displays all concepts with their preferred labels and their alternative labels (synonyms). The list of concepts is displayed in an alphabetical order and can be filtered by their first letters. The second page represents the detail view of each concept. All kinds of labels and relations (prefLabel, altLabel, hiddenLabel, definition, scopNote, broader, narrower und related) of a given term (concept) can be loaded and displayed.
Each post is analysed automatically to find words and phrases maching labels of a concept (prefLabel, altLabel or hiddenLabel) in the thesaurus. The first hit will automatically be highlighted. A mousover tooltip shows the short description of the term/phrase and the link points to the more detailed description on the glossary page.

= What's new? =
* By caching of relevant concepts of a post / article the performance has been optimised when callinga post / article
* The Plugin has been reworked to ensure the use in future WordPress versions

= Features = 
* It is possible to include a list of glossary terms in the settings which will then be excluded from automated linking.
* There is a sidebar-widget which incorporates a search field including autocomplete. This autocomplete service suggests terms from the glossary. Once such a term is chosen, one is automatically connected to the webpage describing the term. The widget can be pulled into any sidebar (depending on the theme) from the sub-section of *Appearance/Widgets*.
* There is a shortcode with which specific parts of the content can be excluded from automatically being linked. The shortcode is called ccg-noparse, and it is opened with *[ccg-noparse]* and closed with *[/ccg-noparse]*. Automated linking is disabled for any text between the code.

Thanks to Benjamin Nowack: The thesaurus is imported into the system and is queried via ARC2 (https://github.com/semsol/arc2).
Thanks to rduffy (http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/profile/rduffy). His *Glossary* Plugin (http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/automatic-glossary) inspired me, and I was able to develop this plugin on top of his ideas.

Works with PHP 5, MySQL 5 und ARC2

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Does my main automatically generated glossary page need to be titled **Glossary**? =
No. It can be called whatever you like. You can enter a content if you like, but be careful with the shortcuts.

= Does my automatically generated subpage need to be titled **Item**? =
No. It can be called whatever you like. You can enter a content if you like, but be careful with the shortcuts.

= How do I add a thesaurus item?  =
You will need a SKOS thesaurus management tool like PoolParty (http://poolparty.biz) to add/modify terms. The glossary is generated automatically from the imported thesaurus.

= How can I exclude certain text sections from automated linking? =
Enclose such text sections with preceding [ccg-noparse] and a final [/ccg-noparse]

= How can I exclude certain glossary terms from automated linking? =
In the settings (admin area: *Settings* -> *Climate change glossary*) under "Terms excluded from automated linking" you can now add a list of glossary terms to be excluded from automated linking. 

= How can I update the glossary? =
Simply load the updated thesaurus again (admin area: *Settings* -> *Climate change glossary*). The old thesaurus will be overwritten. New or updated concepts will be recognized immediately by the link generator.

= How to style the tooltip? =
This tooltip consists of a CSS file and three PNG pictures which can be found in the plugin directory (*js/unitip/*). Two pictures consist of the top and bottom edge with and without the pointer and the third picture consists of the middle part.
To style this tooltip, the three pictures can be interchanged and the CSS file adjusted accordingly.
